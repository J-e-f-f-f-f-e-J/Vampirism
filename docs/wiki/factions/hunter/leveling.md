title: Leveling
---

After becoming a hunter (see [Getting Started](../getting-started#first-steps---hunter)) you probably want to reach higher levels. To level up you have to train yourself somehow.  
_The declared item amounts might not be up-to-date_  

## To reach level 2-4
To reach higher levels you have collect some vampire blood (Kill normal vampire NPCs with a stake).  
If you got enough look around for a normal hunter NPC. Interact with him and a GUI will open.  
Current required counts to reach  

| For Level | [Vampire Blood](../../content/items.mdx#vampire-blood) |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 2         | 1                                                      |
| 3         | 5                                                      |
| 4         | 12                                                     |

## To reach level 5+
To level up further you have to do some research first. Craft yourself a [Hunter Table](../../content/blocks.mdx#hunter-table) and open its GUI. By inspecting some special items you will get some intel/research about vampires which you can use to level up at a [Vampire Hunter Trainer](../../content/entities/hunter_trainer.mdx) in a village.  
For higher tiers of hunter intel you will need to upgrade the hunter table by placing certain blocks adjacent to it.
These blocks are: [Weapon Table](../../content/blocks.mdx#weapon-table), [Potion Table](../../content/blocks.mdx#potion-table) and [Alchemical Cauldron](../../content/blocks.mdx#alchemical-cauldron).  
For the highest tier you will need all three blocks placed adjacent to the hunter table.

#### Training
With the ["Intel"](../../content/items.mdx#hunter-intel) you got visit a [Hunter Trainer](../../content/entities/hunter_trainer.mdx). He will be able to train you for the next level, but you will have to pay him a fee for that. Just open his GUI and take a look.

## Leaving the Faction

If you want to leave the Hunter faction behind you can do so by crafting a [Sanguinare Injection](../../content/effects.mdx#sanguinare-injection) and inject it at an [Injection Chair](../../content/blocks.mdx#injection-chair).
